                            Byomkesh Bakshi is an Indian-Bengali fictional
                            detective created by Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay.
                            Referring to himself as a "truth-seeker" or
                            Satyanweshi in the stories, Bakshi is known for
                            his proficiency with observation, logical reasoning,
                            and forensic science which he uses to solve complicated
                            cases, usually murders. Initially appearing in the 1932
                            story Pother Kanta, the character's popularity immensely
                            increased in Bengal and other parts of India.

                            Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay's most well known fictional character
                            Byomkesh Bakshi first appeared as a character in the story Satyanweshi
                            (The Inquisitor). The story is set in 1932 in the Chinabazar area of
                            Kolkata where a 'non-government detective' Byomkesh Bakshi, owing to
                            the permission from the police commissioner, starts living in a mess
                            in that area under the pseudonym of Atul Chandra Niyogi to probe a
                            series of murders.

                            Most of the stories are written from Ajit Kumar Banerjee's perspective,
                            who meets Byomkesh in the mess at Chinabazar. Byomkesh later asks Ajit
                            to live with him at his three-story rented house at Harrison Road as his
                            assistant and chronicler. The only other person in his household is his
                            attendant Putiram.

                            In the beginning of the stories, Byomkesh Bakshi is described as "a man of
                            twenty-three or twenty-four years of age who looked well educated." Byomkesh
                            is a Hindu and wears mostly a white shirt/kurta with a white dhoti, occasionally
                            draping a shawl. He does not live in luxury but possesses numerous books. He travels
                            frequently, and does not own a gun and does not consider himself to be an "expensive
                            helper". He habitually smokes and drinks tea with milk. He is fluent in Bengali, Hindi,
                            and English. Byomkesh does not like being called a detective, and thinks the word
                            investigator' even worse. Thus he fashions a new name for himself which he inscribes
                            on a brass plate in front of his house. The plaque read "Byomkesh Bakshi: Satyanweshi"
                            (The Inquisitor).

                            It is the first Byomkesh adventure written
                            by Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay.

                            Ajit Bandyopadhyay lives in a hostel, along
                            with some other people. Ashwini Babu and
                            Ghanshyam Babu are two of the hostel inmates;
                            they live next to Ajit. The hostel is run by
                            a philanthropic homeopathic doctor, Anukul
                            Babu. Ajit has recently become aware of some
                            murders that have happened in their locality.
                            They seemed to have been done by the same person,
                            possibly a serial killer.
                            This mystery occasions the arrival of the sleuth
                            Byomkesh and his author friend Ajit to Balabantpur.
                            The visit, however, is under the pretext of an invitation
                            to take part in a hunting expedition. In the course of
                            their stay, they unravel many secrets involving the residents
                            of the palace and also about the topography of Balabantpur.
                            Byomkesh is particularly intrigued by the character of Kaligati,
                            the royal physician, and uncovers several clues which connect
                            Kaligati with the disappearance of Harinath. It is discovered
                            that Alaka is sexually frigid. But she was anxious to continue
                            the bloodline of Himangshu. Not getting any sexual pleasure from his wife,
                            Himangshu was attracted towards Leela, the daughter of Kaligati. On a
                            previous hunting expedition Alaka had sent Leela with Himanghshu instead
                            of herself accompanying him. Thus Leela became pregnant with his child. But
                            Harinath the librarian loved Leela and wanted to marry her despite knowing
                            she was carrying Himangshu's child. Kaligati found this inconvenient as Leela's
                            son would then be officially known as Harinath's son and not Himangshu's.
                            Kaligati wanted to be the grandfather of the royal offspring. Thus he orchestrated
                            Harinath's drowning in quicksand on the night when he discovered Harinath had married
                            Leela. The ensuing story revolves around the detective's unveiling of Kaligati as the
                            culprit behind the mystery of Balabantpur.

                            Written in 1934, it is the third such work of fiction featuring
                            Byomkesh and is written in first-person narrative, as experienced
                            by Byomkesh's friend, associate, and narrator, Ajit Bandyopadhyay.

                            Unlike most of the novels featuring Byomkesh, this one does not involve
                            any violent crime or major plot twists. The story revolves around the
                            theft of a priceless heirloom, the Seemanto-heera or "Frontier Diamond",
                            belonging to the heir of the Roy clan, one of the minor rulers of North
                            Bengal. Byomkesh and Ajit have been invited by the current heir, a young
                            Rai Bahadur Tridibendra Narayan Roy to recover the diamond. The diamond had
                            been in the possession of the ruler for generations and a legend had been built
                            around it. According to the legend, if the diamond were to ever be lost, then
                            the line of succession would end. Tridibendran was the sole heir of his line
                            according to the rules of succession where only the eldest son became ruler,
                            but he did have an uncle, Sir Digindra Narayan Roy who was the younger
                            brother of his father.
